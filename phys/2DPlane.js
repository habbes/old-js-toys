Cartesian Plane

Used to place objects on a cartesian plane. The Plane object
will be responsible of converting between normal cartesian coordinate
system and the computer graphics coordinate system (origin at top left, 
y axis goes down), it will allow for translating or shifting of the plane,
modifying the unit size (zooming) and other functions.

This contains a lot of the code already in Graph (graph.js) used for plotting
functions and points. Had I done this prior, I should have based Graph on this
instead and have this as the basis of subsequent works requiring a 2D
Cartesian Plane (maybe I should extend or generalize to allow 3D)
